# Surftimer-olokos for CS:GO

_I have renamed the repository to Surftimer-olokos just to make it obvious, that we're entering a new chapter in csgo surf community, a milestone._

As you probably all know there's quite some bugs in all open-source versions of cksurf or surftimer.
On this project our main goal is to get bug-free, properly optimized surftimer that would work as we all expect it to, across all configurations.
Because of this, we will be putting new features and additions on the side, as they can potentially introduce new, unknown issues and there's plenty of those already.

**Does it mean this version is buggy?**

Yes, but not any more than other projects currently and for past years.

**Is there any surftimer open-source, which is less buggy then the code in here?**

No, this is currently the only surftimer project which is currently in active development. 
The goal is to allow everybody to have the ability to host a perfect surf server and make surftimer great again! :)
Instead of paying outrageous prices to others to get a plugin or encounter myriad of issues.

## Installation and requirements
[SourceMod 1.10](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable), [MetaMod 1.10](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=stable) and a working MariaDB, or MySQL instance is required for this plugin.

Both MySQL5.7 and MySQL8+ are supported, but we recommend using MariaDB or MySQL8+ to get the best experience.

<sup>(This version also supports SourceMod 1.11 and MetaMod 1.11)</sup>

~ 4GB of RAM

## Point system
<details>
  <summary>explanation</summary> 
  
The points system has seen a massive overhaul from the original ckSurf; it is now a percentile tiered system. Points are now distributed in two ways: (1) map completion, and (2) map ranking. Map completion points will be given to all players who complete a specific and are dependent on the tier.
* Tier 1: 25
* Tier 2: 50
* Tier 3: 100
* Tier 4: 200
* Tier 5: 400
* Tier 6: 600

Map ranking points are dependent upon the individuals ranking on the map. This is done firstly by calculation of the WR points for the map. WR points per tier are calculated as follows:
* Tier 1: WR = (1.75 * Number of Completes) / 6
* Tier 2: WR = (2.8 * Number of Completes) / 5
* Tier 3: WR = MAX(350, (3.5 * Number of Completes) / 4)
* Tier 4: WR = MAX(400, (5.74 * Number of Completes) / 4)
* Tier 5: WR = MAX(500, (7 * Number of Completes) / 4)
* Tier 6: WR = MAX(600, (14 * Number of Completes) / 4)

Once the WR points are calculated the top 10 are points are calculated by multiplying the WR points by a factor. These factors are:
* Rank 2 = WR * 0.8
* Rank 3 = WR * 0.75
* Rank 4 = WR * 0.7
* Rank 5 = WR * 0.65
* Rank 6 = WR * 0.6
* Rank 7 = WR * 0.55
* Rank 8 = WR * 0.5
* Rank 9 = WR * 0.45
* Rank 10 = WR * 0.4

Players who are not in the top 10 but are above the 50th percentile in map ranking will be sorted into 5 groups â€“ with each higher group giving proportionally more points. These groups and their point distribution are as follows:
* Group 1 (top 3.125%) = WR * 0.25
* Group 2 (top 6.25%) = (Group 1) / 1.5
* Group 3 (top 12.5%) = (Group 2) / 1.5
* Group 4 (top 25%) = (Group 3) / 1.5
* Group 5 (top 50%) = (Group 4) / 1.5
